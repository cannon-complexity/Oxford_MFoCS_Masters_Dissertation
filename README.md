# Oxford MFoCS Masters Dissertation

This is my Master's dissertation from Oxford on the subject of comparing the Louvain method versus the Leiden method (complex networks community detection). 

This work received a distinction from the University of Oxford (grade 79/100). 

The full PDF dissertation can be found in this repository. My work was supervised by Professor Renauld Lambiotte (https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/people/renaud.lambiotte). Prof Lambiotte is one of the most important and accomplished complex networks scientists in the world and is an Alan Turing institute fellow (https://www.turing.ac.uk/people/researchers/renaud-lambiotte). 


I am currently reworking this code from a Jupyter notebook into a Python package. The repository for the package is (x).
