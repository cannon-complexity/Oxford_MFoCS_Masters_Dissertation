# Oxford Master's MFoCS Dissertation

This is my Master's dissertation from the university of Oxford on the subject of comparing the Louvain method versus the Leiden method (complex networks community detection). The work is titled 'Louvain and Leiden: Advances in Novel Modularity-Based Community Detection' and received a high distinction grade.

The full PDF dissertation can be found in this repository. My work was supervised by Professor Renauld Lambiotte (https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/people/renaud.lambiotte). Prof Lambiotte is one of the most important and accomplished complex networks scientists in the world and is an Alan Turing institute fellow (https://www.turing.ac.uk/people/researchers/renaud-lambiotte). 


I am currently reworking this code from a Jupyter notebook and into a standalone Python package. The repository for the package is (https://github.com/cannon-complexity/louvainvsleiden).

Here are some of my favourite figures, and some which demonstrate the variables which were measured in my original numerical simulations.
